# The Reconcilers

*They don't save the world. They check it.*

Ten heroes and one villain, packaged as a Claude Code skill plus eleven agent definitions, that you point at any data product: a dashboard, a report, a notebook, a public dataset, a model card, a single-file visualization. Eight own a lane of method. Meld reads the room first. Beacon reads the map back and summons a bespoke specialist for your product's subject, a hero cast for this one job and no other. They work in parallel, they don't compare notes until the end, and every finding has to point at a line, a cell, or a screen. When the findings are in, Doctor Missedit turns up uninvited and audits the auditors, the summon included.

Built on and first run against [The Cape Index](https://capeindex.com), where the team found 78 things, 55 after the overlaps merged, and the Doctor found 7 places the fixes had missed.

## The roster

| Hero | Lane | Model (standard issue) |
|---|---|---|
| **Meld** | Context. Reads the local stack first and draws the map the others follow, so nobody audits a notebook for missing webpack. Runs alone, before anyone else. | Sonnet |
| **Beacon** | The summon. Reads Meld's map and calls the one specialist the standing eight cannot cover: a bespoke hero cast for this product's subject, with its own powers, weakness and model. Runs second. May ask to call a second, and asks you first. | Opus |
| **Ledger** | Data integrity. Every number walks back to a source, or it doesn't get on the page. | Opus |
| **Doppel** | Entities and consistency. The same thing under two names; two things under one. | Opus |
| **Median** | Statistics. The n behind every average, the denominator behind every rate. | Opus |
| **Chartjunk** | Visualization craft. Has made every misleading chart once, so recognizes them on sight. | Opus |
| **Thumb** | UX. Uses the product the way a stranger does, on a phone, without the docs. | Sonnet |
| **Greyscale** | Accessibility. Reads the product through every channel except color. | Sonnet |
| **Redline** | Editorial. The headline has to say the finding, and the finding has to be true. | Opus |
| **Payload** | Engineering, security, performance. Is the network tab. | Sonnet |
| **Doctor Missedit** | The audit itself. May only remove confidence from a finding, never add one. Arrives after the heroes, without being asked. | Fable |

Full powers, weaknesses and origins are in `agents/*.md` and on [the Reconcilers site](https://reconcilers.billyost.com/#roster). Watch the [first episode](https://reconcilers.billyost.com/episode).

There are two model rosters. **Standard issue** is the table above. **Flamethrower** puts every hero on Fable. The skill asks which you want before it dispatches anyone, and tells you what it will cost you in tokens, because it is a lot.

## Install

**Import the zip into Claude** (easiest, and it follows your account everywhere). In Claude, open Customize, then Skills, then Import skill, and pick `reconcilers.zip`. Open the folder you want audited and say `/reconcilers`. The heroes ride along inside the skill, so the team still runs in parallel.

**Copy it into one project.** From the folder that holds the product you want audited:

```bash
bash <path-to-this-folder>/install.sh                        # macOS / Linux
& "<path-to-this-folder>\install.ps1"                        # Windows PowerShell
```

Copies `agents/*.md` into `.claude/agents/` and `SKILL.md` into `.claude/skills/reconcilers/`. Nothing is installed globally; the team is scoped to the repo you called them for.

**Codex.** Same folder, pass `--platform codex`:

```bash
bash <path-to-this-folder>/install.sh --platform codex       # macOS / Linux
& "<path-to-this-folder>\install.ps1" -Platform codex        # Windows PowerShell
```

Copies the episode to `reconcilers-episode.md` at the repo root and adds five lines to `AGENTS.md` pointing at it. An `AGENTS.md` you already have is kept, with the section appended. The episode itself stays out of the root file on purpose: Codex reads `AGENTS.md` on startup, and so does Claude Code (2.1.277 and later) in any folder with no `CLAUDE.md`, so anything in there is context every session pays for.

**Any other runtime.** Read `adapters/PORTING.md`: it defines the protocol in one page so a Cursor rules file, an Aider `CONVENTIONS.md`, a Cline `CLAUDE.md`, or a shell script can host the team. The mandates travel unchanged; only the surrounding metadata (dispatcher, model choice, tools) is per-runtime.

**As a plugin.** This repo is its own marketplace, so Claude Code can install the skill and all eleven heroes in one go:

```
/plugin marketplace add cruce5/reconcilers
/plugin install reconcilers@reconcilers
```

Plugin heroes answer to scoped names (`reconcilers:ledger`), which the skill works out for itself.

To uninstall, delete whatever the installer copied, remove the imported skill in Customize, or `/plugin uninstall`.

## Call them

Claude Code:

```
claude
/reconcilers
```

Codex:

```
codex
> run the Reconcilers episode against this repo
```

The skill asks three things: what the product is (one line), which model roster, and whether it may use the browser. Then Meld goes in, then Beacon calls the specialist, then the eight and the summon run together, then the report, then the surprise.

Every report lands in `.reconcilers/` inside the target directory: `context.md` (Meld's map), one file per hero, `REPORT.md` (the compiled, ranked, deduplicated list), and `missedit.md` (the verdicts). Add `.reconcilers/` to your `.gitignore` or commit it; both are fine.

## House rules

- Read-only. The team never edits your product, commits, or deploys. Fixing is a separate conversation, and you start it.
- Only verified findings. Reasoned-but-not-checked goes in a "suspected" list at the bottom, never in the ranking.
- Every finding cites a location: `file:line`, a data key, or a screen and a viewport width.
- Every report ends with "Checked clean", so silence is never ambiguous.
- No em dashes. It's a team quirk. Don't fight it.

## Why the villain

Auditors have characteristic false positives, and nobody checks the checkers. On the first run, two of Thumb's findings were artifacts of a hidden browser pane, Median's recomputation moved a number's confidence without changing the sentence, and Ledger pinned one film at the top of a range one paragraph after praising the bottom-of-range rule. The Doctor's job is to know each hero's tell and read every finding with it in one hand and the evidence in the other. His report has three verdicts per finding: stands, downgraded (with the reason), or artifact (with the mechanism), plus a fourth for a run where fixes have already landed: fix mismatch.

Same Bat-time. Same Bat-channel.
